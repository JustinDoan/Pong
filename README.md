# Pong
Pong game originally for Class assignment, but many many more things added.

This was orginally a class assignment for a web design class, the only goal was to modify variables and that would be the entire assignment. 

However, I noticed that the code will not function correctly on monitors with different refresh rates due to usage of 
requestAnimationFrame, and mentioned this to the teacher of the class. He didn't seem to understand my reasoning at all, and still failed to understand it even after a 5 page discussion post on it.
He still has refused to give me points back that i've lost on this assignment.

So to make an example, I've decided to go ahead and make this assignment correctly.

I've added in options to control both TPS and FPS in the assignment which prevents the assignment from being borked on computers with more than 60hz refresh rate.
I've also added far more options to the game than was orginally in it, and plan to continue to add to it.
